# Aegis-Infinitum
Aegis Infinitum

Aegis Infinitum is a low-fantasy ARPG. Open-ended, yet streamlined, </br>
action-packed, yet tactical. Imagine a living, breathing world that </br>
reacts to your every action. Quests, adventures, and hidden treasure </br>
troves fill every corner of Caltir, the continent on which the game </br>
takes place.
